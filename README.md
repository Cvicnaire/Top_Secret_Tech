Extremely Rough outline of what we could possibly do with a workflow manager


** How to use:
1. clone repo
2. run this command "python3 workflow_compose.py"
3. you can change what tasks you want to be used in the workflow inside the variables.txt

This is still rough around the edges! 
adding additional flags dynamically is not working yet
